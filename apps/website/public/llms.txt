# Muhammet Mustafa Bilgin

> Someone who enjoys designing, developing, and solving problems using web technologies. I have improved myself in these areas and I believe I am capable of putting pieces together and designing things. Details are what make the whole beautiful, and in this context, I think that every detail should be close to perfection in terms of beauty. I believe this makes me competent.
